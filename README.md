## This fork implements:
* Twig Template Engine (HTML moved to templates directory)
* Language in separate language files 
* Filters in the download section

## On my todo list are:
* Fancy landing page that explains what the DDB is for
* Fancy fillindevice page that explains (better) what the options are for
* Some documentation of the download functions

## To install [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org)
* install package manager [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) (if it's not installed already)
* run `composer update` in the DDB directory. This will automatically install twig, as defined in the composer.json file
